### %white% ‚û• Introduction %%
!!! info OK so this is a thorough article that includes extra information, any non critical information is colored %orange% orange%%
%orange% DODI is a well known repacker who "repacks" games on the internet. Repacks are essentially just games that have been compressed to reduce their file sizes when downloading. DODI does not crack (remove DRM) from games%%
***
### %white% ‚û• How to navigate on DODI Repacks %%
##### ‚ù±‚ù± Navigating the correct site
!!! note
	**%aqua%The one and only DODI repacks website is %% dodi-repacks.site **
	**%aqua%The one and only DODI repacks backup website is%% dodi-repacks.download**
##### ‚ù±‚ù± Using an Adblocker
%orange% Now piracy isn't exactly legal so the filehoster sites that are used are of course less than legit, the ads there contain malware (this is the case for almost all piracy sites) so you must have an adblocker. The in-built AdBlockers that come with browsers like Edge/Brave/Opera/Opera GX are NOT STRONG ENOUGH. You must either download LibreWolf (based on Firefox and comes with uBlock Origin by default) Or get uBlock Origin Lite (non lite only works on Firefox) if you don't want to switch%%
%lime% ***HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*** %% [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/installation/)
 %lime% ***uBlock Origin***  %% Just get it from the Chrome web store or wherever you get extensions from. If you don't know how to do that then just google "how to download extensions (your browser)"

### %white% ‚û• How to Download a game from DODI Repacks %%
> !!! note %white% **WARNING! **  %%
> 	  **If in any case you get a file that has a password, or the file is not a torrent file and it's size is not anywhere near the size of the game, then what you downloaded probably isn't the game**  %white% **DODI NEVER PUTS PASSWORDS TO HIS FILES! (if he did he'll tell you on his site)**%% **You need to have the bare minimum common sense that a 20GB+ game cannot come from a 17MB setup (just an example).**

##### ‚ù±‚ù± Steps to download a game from DODI-Repacks
!!! note All the instructions below assumes you are using LibreWolf or have an adblocker
!!! note if uBlock warns you about a site then that site is likely bad, go back and try the link again
#### ‚ù±‚ù± %magenta%Torrent%%
-Torrenting is the most convenient way to get your games, it does come with some caveats however
-If you are in Argentina, the US, Canada, UK, UAE, Korea, Italy, France, Japan, Spain, Netherlands, Mexico, Turkey, New Zealand, or Australia. You need a VPN for torrenting. If you are not in one of those countries then you do not need a VPN, no point in wasting your money on one. ProtonVPN premium is highly recommended for it's port forwarding, if you already have a VPN then yes you may use it.
%orange% **If you want to know how torrenting works - **  %% **[Queen's Guide to Torrents](https://majesty.lol/post/introduction-to-torrents)**
-You will need to download a BitTorrent client, [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download) is the best client, if you are using uTorrent or BitTorrent uninstall them and replace them with qBit, those two have had malware injected into them before.
-qBittorrent will need some setting up. 
1. Enable your VPN, then go to settings (the gear icon) and connections, uncheck all 4 connections limits, all they do is slow things down. If you have ProtonVPN enable port forwarding and set its port here.
2. Next go to advanced, network interface, set this to your VPN, this is better than a killswitch and will make it impossible for your IP to leak. It is also recommended to have recheck torrents on completion checked.
3. For best speed set your VPN to use Wireguard UDP (if you don't know how to then google it) (if it doesn't say UDP then oh well). If it does not have Wireguard then have it prefer UDP, if there is nothing with UDP then your VPN is probably shit 
It is now time to torrent your games, go to the site, find the game, and do the torrent. Open the .torrent file it downloaded. If the link doesn't work then try a different one. If all links are down or you know what you're looking for find the game on 1337X.to, make sure DODI is the uploader, do the magnet.
#### ‚ù±‚ù± %magenta% Multi-Hosts (500 MB | 2GB | 10GB Links)%%
* Always remember my warning given in red above.üîº
* Always use a download manager like [JDownloader 2](https://jdownloader.org/download/index) for faster downloads
* DDLs do not require a VPN
* While downloading from multi-hosts, i.e., as parts of 500MB or 2GB or 10GB each, make sure you download all the files in correct order and make sure you DON'T RENAME THE FILES. The files should be downloaded to a single directory with the same names as given originally. Else there would be a tremendous task in renaming and rearranging the files, and what if *just* one file got accidentally deleted and you cannot find it on the site because it was taken down due to copyright. Omfg just the thought of this makes me real mad
!!! danger Red arrows/markers means it will redirect to a malicious site and Green means it is the correct one but it *might* redirect to a malicious site also. As always (and this guide already mentioned) DON'T TURN OFF YOUR ADBLOCKER! 
1. %lime%**Pastebin**%%
	1. You will see a list of links arranged in order.
	2. Copy-paste each link onto your browser and click go. Download each file.
1. %lime%**Multi-up¬∑org**%%
	1. Downloading from Multi-up is very straightforward. Don't disable Adblocker, you can still download with an Adblocker on.
	2. Click on the big blue `DOWNLOAD` button to get a variety of sites that have the file.
	3. Sites that show `Invalid Now` will not have the file as it might get removed due to copyright. Click on the `Download` button on the ones that show `Valid Now`
	4. Most of the sites have a cooldown before the next download, so its kinda annoying, in such a case, switch to torrenting
1. %lime%**Loot-Link¬∑com**%%
	1. This may seem absurd to download opera gx or enabling notifications or reading news to get the files at first, but, theres a workaround.
	2. Click on `DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL` Button.
	3. Close the pop-up immediately as it opens and dont let it start the download.
	4. Let the loading icon twist for a long time
	5. The content will automatically unlock after approx. 30s. Click on `UNLOCK CONTENT` to get to pastebin where you will see the download links
1. %lime%**Health Shield / Policy Buzz etc (tii¬∑la)**%%
	1. Solve the `reCAPTCHA (I am human)` and click on `Continue`
	2. Wait for 10 seconds and click `Continue...`
	3. A pop-up will come as a new tab (redirect). CLOSE IT.
	4. Scroll down and you will find `Get Link Here` . Click it
	5. A Redirect again! CLOSE IT!
	2. Wait for 10 seconds and click `Get Link` to get to pastebin where you will see the download links
6. %lime%**Swift Files**%%
	1. Ads are everywhere, so please use Ublock Origin it will help alot. And I will mark the fake stuff through screenshots below.
	1. Opening the site for the first time and if you click anywhere it will redirect to a fake/malicious site, thankfully uBlock blocks it already.
	![Swift Files](https://imgur.com/cTNPxKT.png){80%:80%}
	1. Now after scrolling down click "Regular Download" most of the times it won't redirect to a malicious site. If it does uBlock closes the popup immediately. After you're in a new link it will also redirect if you click on it first time so ignore or close the popup if uBlock doesn't block it.
	1. You will another of the first screenshot's "Download Now" button it's still the same and won't lead you to your actual download link.
	1. See below and enter the code for the captcha then it will start downloading.

#### ‚ù±‚ù± %magenta%**KrakenFiles¬∑com**%%
1. The download process is simple and very straightforward. Click the `Download now` button on the bottom left

### %white% ‚û• How to install games%%
If you have done a DDL then download [7-ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) select all parts, and use 7Z to extract them (on windows 11 you'll have to click more options to find 7Z
Once they're done open the folder and run the setup. It is not recommended to delete the parts until the game is verified to work.
If you want to play a game online then you may have to go to http://online-fix.me for the online fix.
If you did the torrent run the setup. 
## %white% ‚û• Fixing Common Errors %%
It is common to encounter various errors and problems during/after installation of DODI Repacks, Here are some common fixes:
1. **Install to games NOT Program Files (x86)**
2. **Turn off antivirus during setup**
3. **Add an exclusion to the directory where you normally install your games to, for example C:\Games**
4. **Un-select the "DirectX 9.0c" option unless it's your first time
5. **Prefer installing onto Shorter path.** 
***
Installer errors 
‚Ä¢ -11 write operation failed | not enough storage
‚Ä¢ Not UNArc Archive | download all parts or redownload corrupted (incorrect size but not the last) part
‚Ä¢ -14 not FreeARC or archive is corrupt | download all parts, if you have a part of the incorrect size and its not the final part then redownload it
‚Ä¢ For ANYTHING that says failed CRC check or corrupt, assuming you did the torrent,  go to qBittorrent, right click the torrent, hit force recheck, rerun setup when it finishes
***
### %white% ‚û• Did you download a wrong file? %%
If you downloaded a "setup exe" likely from mega, likely password protected, likley way too small to fit the game, and that didn't do anything when ran, then you have ran malware. Go to [my malware removal guide](https://rentry.org/XTXs-malware-removal-guide)
